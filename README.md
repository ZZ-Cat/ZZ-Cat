## About me

I am an independent firmware developer for free and open source embedded systems.  
My focus is with robustness, reliability, and security. The latter of which I take _very_ seriously.

### Coding languages

My languages of choice are ordered with my most commonly used language first:

1. C++
2. Expression2
3. Python
4. Lua
5. Rust

C++ is my dominant language of choice when it comes to writing firmware for embedded systems, and I have been using C++ since 2013.  
For me, it _is_ a legacy language that I am branching away from in favour of learning memory-safe languages. For my existing C++ projects (suc as CRSF for Arduino) are still actively being maintained unless I have written otherwise in a particular repository.

### Development Environments

Having my start with the Arduino IDE in 2013, as this is what introduced me to C++, I now prefer to use PlatformIO due to its streamlined integrations and package managements _without_ being locked to one vendor over another.  
However, this may change as I wind down my C++ projects and start creating newer embedded projects with Rust and Python.
