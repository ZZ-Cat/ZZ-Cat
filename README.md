## About me

I am an independent firmware developer for free and open source embedded systems.  
My focus is with robustness, reliability, and security. The latter of which I take _very_ seriously.

### Coding languages

My languages of choice are ordered with my most commonly used language first:

1. C++
2. Rust
3. Python

C++ is the language I have spent the most time with since 2013. It is now a legacy language for me, and over time I amm discontinuing its use in my projects in favour of Rust and Python.  
Rust is an _extremely new_ language to me. However, my newer projects will be built with Rust instead of C++.  
In a project where I am unable to use Rust, it will be built with Python via one of its many flavours (EG CircuitPython, MicroPython etc).

### Development Environments

Having my start with the Arduino IDE in 2013, as this is what introduced me to C++, I now prefer to use PlatformIO due to its streamlined integrations and package managements _without_ being locked to one vendor over another.  
However, this may change as I wind down my C++ projects and start creating newer embedded projects with Rust and Python.
