## About me

I am an independent firmware developer for free and open source embedded systems.  
My focus is with robustness, reliability, and security. The latter of which I take _very_ seriously.

### Coding languages

My languages of choice are ordered with my most commonly used language first:

1. C++
2. Expression2
3. Python
4. Lua
5. Rust


### Development Environments

Having my start with the Arduino IDE in 2013, as this is what introduced me to C++, I now prefer to use PlatformIO due to its streamlined integrations and package managements _without_ being locked to one vendor over another.  
However, this may change as I wind down my C++ projects and start creating newer embedded projects with Rust and Python.
